## CSS FLEXBOX PHOTO GALLERY

Flexbox helps you design your webpage so that it looks good on any screen size.

In this course, you'll use Flexbox to build a responsive photo gallery webpage.

Standard HTML boilerplate

In order to better visualize how your elements are sized, adding a border can be helpful.
Give your .gallery element a width of 50% and a border set to 5px solid red.
Then give your img elements a width of 100%, padding set to 5px, and a border set to 5px solid blue.

Notice how the blue image border extends beyond the red gallery border. This is due to the way browsers calculate the size of container elements.
The box-sizing property is used to set this behavior. By default, the content-box model is used. With this model, when an element has a specific width, that width is calculated based only on the element's content. Padding and border values get added to the total width, so the element grows to accommodate these values.
Try setting box-sizing to content-box explicitly, with the global * selector. At this point, you will not see any changes, because you are using the default value.

The border-box sizing model does the opposite of content-box. The total width of the element, including padding and border, will be the explicit width set. The content of the element will shrink to make room for the padding and border.
Change the box-sizing property to border-box. Notice how your blue image borders now fit within your red gallery border.
